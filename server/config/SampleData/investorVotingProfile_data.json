Nonetheless, BlackRock may support the proposal where the company:<br />\r\n• Appears to have a legitimate financing motive for requesting blank check authority<br />\r\n• Has committed publicly that blank check preferred shares will not be used for anti-takeover purposes<br />\r\n• Has a history of using blank check preferred stock for financings<br />\r\n• Has blank check preferred stock previously outstanding such that an increase would not necessarily provide further anti-takeover protection but may provide greater financing flexibility",

    "ESG_overview": "BlackRock's fiduciary duty to clients is to protect and enhance their economic interest in the companies in which they invest on their behalf. It is within this context that BlackRock undertake their corporate governance activities. BlackRock believe that well -managed companies will deal effectively with the material environmental and social (“E&S”) factors relevant to their businesses. Robust disclosure is essential for investors to effectively gauge companies’ business practices and planning related to E&S risks and opportunities.\r\n<br/><br/>BlackRock expects companies to issue reports aligned with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and the standards put forward by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB). BlackRock view the SASB and TCFD frameworks as complementary in achieving the goal of disclosing more financially material information, particularly as it relates to industry-specific metrics and target setting. TCFD’s recommendations provide an overarching framework for disclosure on the business implications of climate change, and potentially other E&S factors. BlackRock find SASB’s industry-specific guidance (as identified in its materiality map) beneficial in helping companies identify and discuss their governance, risk assessments, and performance against these key performance indicators (KPIs). Any global standards adopted, peer group benchmarking undertaken, and verification process in place should also be disclosed and discussed in this context.\r\n\r\n<br/><br/>BlackRock has been engaging with companies for several years on disclosure of material E&S factors. Given the increased understanding of sustainability risks and opportunities, and the need for better information to assess them, BlackRock specifically ask companies to:\r\n<br/>1) Publish disclosures in line with industry specific SASB guidelines by year-end, if they have not already done so, or disclose a similar set of data in a way that is relevant to their particular business; and\r\n<br/>2) Disclose climate-related risks in line with the TCFD’s recommendations, if they have not already done so. This should include the company’s plan for operating under a scenario where the Paris Agreement’s goal of limiting global warming to less than two degrees is fully realized, as expressed by the TCFD guidelines.\r\n\r\n<br/><br/>See BlackRock's commentary on their approach to engagement on TCFD and SASB aligned reporting for greater detail of their expectations.\r\n\r\n<br/><br/>BlackRock will use these disclosures and their engagements to ascertain whether companies are properly managing and overseeing these risks within their business and adequately planning for the future. In the absence of robust disclosures, investors, including BlackRock, will increasingly conclude that companies are not adequately managing risk.\r\n\r\n<br/><br/>BlackRock believe that when a company is not effectively addressing a material issue, its directors should be held accountable. BlackRock will generally engage directly with the board or management of a company when they identify issues. BlackRock may vote against the election of directors where they have concerns that a company might not be dealing with E&S factors appropriately. Sometimes BlackRock may reflect such concerns by supporting a shareholder proposal on the issue, where there seems to be either a significant potential threat or realized harm to shareholders’ interests caused by poor management of material E&S factors. In deciding their course of action, BlackRock will assess the nature of their engagement with the company on the issue over time, including whether:\r\n<br/>? The company has already taken sufficient steps to address the concern\r\n<br/>? The company is in the process of actively implementing a response\r\n<br/>? There is a clear and material economic disadvantage to the company in the near-term if the issue is not addressed in the manner requested by the shareholder proposal \r\n\r\n<br/><br/>BlackRock do not see it as their role to make social, ethical, or political judgments on behalf of clients, but rather, to protect their long-term economic interests as shareholders. BlackRock expect investee companies to comply, at a minimum, with the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which they operate. They should explain how they manage situations where such laws or regulations are contradictory or ambiguous.",

BlackRock expect companies to convey their governance around this issue through their corporate disclosures aligned with TCFD and SASB. For companies in sectors that are significantly exposed to climate-related risk, BlackRock expect the whole board to have demonstrable fluency in how climate risk affects the business and how management approaches assessing, adapting to, and mitigating that risk. \r\n\r\n<br/><br/>Where a company receives a shareholder proposal related to climate risk, in addition to the factors laid out above, BlackRock's assessment will take into account the robustness of the company’s existing disclosures as well as their understanding of its management of the issues as revealed through their engagements with the company and board members over time. In certain instances, BlackRock may disagree with the details of a climate-related shareholder proposal but agree that the company in question has not made sufficient progress on climate-related disclosures.

NPS owns 8.2% of KEPCO.[[B]]\r\n\r\nKEPCO is already under fire from a number of its other investors, with some warning they may go so far as to divest if KEPCO continues to develop new coal-fired plants outside of Korea. Critics include BlackRock, which sent a letter to KEPCO earlier this year asking for better disclosure on this issue. \"KEPCO should take note of the ways in which leading global investors such as BlackRock may react to KEPCO's current climate strategy and energy transition plans,\" the letter read.\r\n\r\nNPS, the third-largest shareholder of KEPCO, has so far declined to add its voice to the call to move away from coal. This is despite a drive for active stewardship that has seen the pension giant engage with the management of other large companies such as Samsung Electronics. A spokesperson for NPS defended the decision not to weigh in on KEPCO yet. \"We need time for our decision makers to review our investments in KEPCO,\" the spokesperson said.",

      "shortArticle": "Executives at German pharmaceutical firm Bayer AG are facing considerable opposition from a number of large shareholders ahead of the firm's annual meeting later this week. Specifically, shareholders have said they will not support executives and board members in a no-confidence vote, that despite not having legal implications, will raise questions about the future of Bayer's chief executive Werner Baumann.\r\n\r\nThe opposition is centered around Bayer's acquisition of US agriculture firm Monsanto last year. Lawsuits and health concerns connected with Roundup, Monsanto's weedkiller product, have caused Bayer's share price to plummet by 38 percent. Ingo Speich of Deka Investment, one of Bayer's disgruntled shareholders, said: \"In all good conscience, we can’t exculpate management if so much shareholder value is destroyed.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to people close to the matter, fellow shareholders BlackRock and DWS, the asset manager of Deutsche Bank, are both intending to abstain from the vote. Proxy advisers Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services have both called for a vote of no confidence in Mr Baumann and other senior executives.",

      "shortArticle": "Based on research on common ownership theory carried out by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), European lawmakers are currently looking at the threat posed by large index fund managers.\r\n\r\nCommon ownership is a theory developed within US academic circles. It argues that passive index fund managers, owning stakes in multiple companies within a sector, are incentivized to constrain competition within that sector. According to the OECD research, the three largest international index fund managers, BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, collectively own 17.6 percent of 1,662 listed US firms.\r\n\r\nLast week, the OECD research was quoted by the European Parliament. The institution stated that higher levels of common ownership would have a \"hidden social cost and reduced product competition.\" For instance, German Green MEP Sven Giegold argued that the \"dramatic change in the asset management industry\" could be dangerous to the running of a market economy. He went on to call for large index fund houses to be regulated.\r\n\r\nThese concerns are not new. Last year, EU competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager began looking into the effects of common ownership on competition. The debate  is also at a nascent stage within the US, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) conducting a hearing on the subject of common ownership last month.\r\n\r\nLarge index fund managers, however, argue that the OECD research is flawed. BlackRock sent a letter to the FTC's hearing on common ownership, stating: \"Any debate on ‘common ownership’ should be grounded in accurate and robust analysis. To date, the existing research does not meet this standard.\"\r\n\r\nThe index fund managers also contend that the incentive to reduce competition between firms does not exist and that the research does not take into account the influence of proxy advisers over shareholder voting. Speaking on the subject, BlackRock vice-chair Barbara Novick said that attempts to constrain large index fund managers were seeking \"to fix a problem that does not exist.\" She also noted that possible solutions, such as limiting managers to one equity stake per sector, were a \"cause for concern.\"",
