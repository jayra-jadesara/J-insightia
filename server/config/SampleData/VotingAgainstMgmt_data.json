The proponent asserts that Apple has cooperated in the past with requests from the Chinese government to restrict free speech and free access to information. The statement says the company has removed virtual private network (VPN) applications from its Chinese App Store, has taken off the New York Times application after a request from the Chinese government, and has removed other apps without explanation of why they were removed. According to the company's transparency report, Apple removed 634 apps in 2018 for “legal violation,” 517 of them in China. Apple disclosed that the “vast majority relate to illegal gambling or pornography,” but did not indicate why the others were removed. The Proposal would not elicit disclosure about actions, such as the removal of gambling or pornography"
